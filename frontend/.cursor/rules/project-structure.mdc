# Project Structure

This document outlines the project structure for our React TypeScript project, and provides guidelines for organizing files.
Our application uses TanStack Query to handle our calls and state management.

## Root Directory

*   `.git/`: Contains Git version control information.
*   `dist/`: Contains the build output of the project. (This is generated and should not be manually edited).
*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
*   `package-lock.json`: Records the exact versions of dependencies. (Managed by npm/yarn).
*   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
*   `node_modules/`: Contains installed npm packages. (Managed by npm/yarn, not version controlled by default).
*   `public/`: Contains static assets that are publicly accessible.
    *   *Purpose*: Store images, fonts, or other files that don't need processing by the build system.
*   `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
*   `.cursor/`: Cursor specific files.
*   `src/`: Contains the main source code for the application. (See details below).
*   `TO_FIX.md`: A markdown file for tracking items that need to be fixed.
*   `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite.
*   `components.json`: a configuration file used by the shadcn/ui library. It defines how shadcn/ui should behave in your project.
*   `tsconfig.app.json`: TypeScript configuration specific to the application code.
*   `tsconfig.json`: Root TypeScript configuration file.
*   `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript configuration for Node.js specific parts of the project (e.g., build scripts).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `eslint.config.js`: Configuration file for ESLint.

## `src` Directory - Application Source Code

This is where the core logic and UI of our application resides.

*   `assets/`: Static assets used within the application code.
    *   *Purpose*: Store images, icons, or other media files that are imported and used by our components.
*   `main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
    *   *Purpose*: Initializes the React application and renders the root component.
*   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
    *   `requestWithAuth.ts`: Hook for making API requests that require authentication.
    *   `requestNoAuth.ts`: Hook for making API requests that do not require authentication.
    *   *Purpose*: Encapsulate reusable stateful logic and side effects.
*   `components/`:
    *   *Purpose*: Contains all React components.
        *   `ui/`: General-purpose, reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, inputs, modals - usually from shadcn/ui). These are often stateless or have minimal internal logic.
        *   `pages/`: Components that represent entire pages or views of the application. These typically compose smaller components from `ui/` and feature-specific directories.
        *   Feature-specific directories (e.g., `opportunities/`, `prospects/`, `dashboard/`): Components related to a particular page, feature or domain of the application.
        *   `layout/`: Components that define the overall structure and layout of the application (e.g., header, footer, sidebar, main content area).
        *   `auth/`: Components related to user authentication (e.g., login forms, registration forms, protected route HOCs).
*   `lib/`: Utility functions and libraries.
    *   `utils.ts`: General utility functions.
    *   *Purpose*: Store helper functions, constants, or third-party library configurations that are not specific to any single component or feature.
*   `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
    *   *Purpose*: Define data structures and interfaces used throughout the application. This helps with type safety and code clarity.
*   `context/`: React Context API providers and consumers.
    *   *Purpose*: Share global state or data across different parts of the component tree without prop drilling.
*   `index.css`: Global styles for the application.
    *   *Purpose*: Base styles, resets, or utility classes that apply to the entire application.
*   `vite-env.d.ts`: TypeScript definitions for Vite environment variables.

## General Guidelines for Development

*   **Routing**: (Using React Router Dom)
    *   Route definitions are placed in `app.tsx` file at the root of `src/`.
    *   Page components (from `src/components/pages/`) are typically rendered by these routes.
